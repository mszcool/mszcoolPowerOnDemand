A simple solution for powering on (and off) physical and virtual machines. For physical machines, an agent as well as a .NET Core capable IoT device is needed that sends a WoL magic packet in a local network to the machine to be powered on.

I also plan to "over-complicate" the architecture of this solution a bit so that I can use it as a more complex demo for a variety of Azure Services I am dealing with on a daily basis with my global software vendor partners!

Currently, this is work-in-progress, so don't expect to clone and run this, it won't work, yet!
